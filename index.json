Wouldn’t it be nice to have a display that automatically reads your twitter mentions and show it on a scrolling display? So let’s build a internet controlled (IoT) dot-matrix display that does this for us using an ESP8266.\nThe plan to accomplish this is as follows:  Someone mentions us on twitter (in my case @debsahu) IF This Then That (IFTTT) tracks these mentions and posts this data on Adafruit.io (MQTT Broker) An ESP8266 connects to Adafruit.io and shows this data on a Dot-Matrix display  We can’t control who mentions us on twitter, so we move to the second step in our plan to configure IFTTT and Adafruit.io.\nTo setup a data feed (MQTT topic) on Adafruit.io,  Goto “feed” and “Create New Feed” Provide a unique name for the feed like “twitter-calls”, this means the MQTT topic that we need to subscribe to is “feed/twitter-calls”  To setup IFTTT to connect to twitter and Adafruit.io,  Connect your twitter and Adafruit.io account to IFTTT by logging in and giving proper permissions Create a new applet For “this“: Select “twitter” and “New mention of you” For “that“: Select “Adafruit” and “Send data to Adafruit.io”. Remember to select the correct topic created above and a message template using ingredients that suits your need.  As a part of the third step in our plan, we need to subscribe to our MQTT topic and display this data on a Dot-Matrix display.\nHardware  Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266) Max7219 Dot Matrix Display  Software  Setup Arduino IDE to be able to program an ESP8266 (Instructions on how to do this is here as well as in the video below).
