      <description>Using esp8266-google-home-notifier library on ESP8266 to make Google Home speak!
Software Prerequisites/Limitations  The GoogleHomeName must match the name of Google Home / mini setup in Google Home App. The ESP8266 must be on the same network as Google Home. MDNS: Dont include ESP8266mDNS.h supplied by Arduino-ESP8266. Internal ESP8266mDNS.h should suffice.  Libraries required  esp8266-google-home-notifier esp8266-google-tts WiFiManager (optional)  GitHub: debsahu/GoogleSay sercret.h
#define SECRET const char* ssid = &amp;quot;&amp;lt;WiFiSSID&amp;gt;&amp;quot;; const char* password = &amp;quot;&amp;lt;WiFiPassword&amp;gt;&amp;quot;; GoogleSay.</description>

      <description>Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be cool for many McLighting (RGB LED lighting using NeoPixels) to talk to each other and synchronize? Here is my naive attempt at this, which requires McLighting to be served as stand-alone web-client.

      <description>A simple Arduino library that retrieves live stock prices from www.robinhood.com in JSON format and processes it for ESP8266. In one example, we demonstrate a whole bunch of stock prices scrolling through a dot-matrix display.
Github: debsahu/RobinhoodAPI An Arduino library to talk to Robin Hood using non-documented Rest API made for ESP8266. Some unofficial documentaion by @sanko is available at here]

      <description>Control components on Home Assistant directly from ESP8266. This is an Arduino Library that can be used in various projects without the requirement of setup of a MQTT sensor + automation on HA. This uses RESTful API commands.
Idea  Control components on Home Assistant directly from ESP8266.  Implementation  Develop an Arduino Library that can be used in various projects without the requirement of setup of a MQTT sensor + automation on HA.</description>

      <title>Talking to Twitter Using TwitterWebAPI for ESP8266</title>

      <description>Idea:  Use ESP8266 to talk to Twitter Get User Data or Tweet or Search Twitter Display the data on a Dot-Matrix display  Implementation I created an Arduino library to talk to Twitter using its Web API made for ESP8266. There are other approaches like using a bearer token arduino-twitter-api, but comes with limitations in terms of not being able to send tweet. This Arduino library TwitterWebAPI can both search/read and post tweets.</description>

      <title>Internet Connected Smoke Alarm</title>
      <link>https://www.debashishsahu.com/posts/internet-connected-smoke-alarm/</link>

      <guid>https://www.debashishsahu.com/posts/internet-connected-smoke-alarm/</guid>
      <description>Have you wondered how to build a internet connected smoke alarm using ESP8266 and a cheap Kidde RF-SM-DC?
Overall idea is to detect smoke alarm signals and send MQTT message. Home Assistant reads the MQTT message and sends out notifications that can be used to notify your local fire station.
ESP8266 sends a MQTT message until the smoke alarm is beeping.
Software Refer to https://github.com/debsahu/ESP_External_Interrupt to build the ESP8266 part of the internet connected smoke alarm.</description>

      <title>Extreme Power-Save Mode: ESP8266 Powered ON After External Interrupt</title>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how to turn on ESP8266 using external interrupt? Build a battery powered amazon dash button or a 18650 lipo powered door bell using ESP8266 without putting the device in deep sleep? Here is your answer.
Idea  Keep ESP8266 on OFF mode as default External 3.3V signal (can be short or long) arrives and turns ON ESP8266 ESP8266 wakes up and keeps itself awake until a task is perfomed Send MQTT data to server Put ESP8266 back to power OFF state  Implementation  RST pin is always HIGH/3.</description>

      <title>Internet Connected Dog Water Bowl Sensor</title>

      <description>Wouldn’t it be nice to know if your dog’s water bowl is empty? Let us build a sensor that measures the water level every 5 minutes. This value is sent to MQTT server and Home Assistant automation takes care of the rest.
This sensor connects to MQTT and Home Assistant. See dogsensor.yaml for adding this to HA. Assumes that one has set up various notification sensors available in HA.</description>

      <title>IoT Dot Matrix Display: Twitter Mentions Using ESP8266 Adafruit.io and IFTTT</title>

      <description>Let’s say that you don’t have your smartphone around and someone mentions you on twitter. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a display that automatically reads your twitter mentions and show it on a scrolling display? So let’s build a internet controlled (IoT) dot-matrix display that does this for us using an ESP8266.
The plan to accomplish this is as follows:  Someone mentions us on twitter (in my case @debsahu) IF This Then That (IFTTT) tracks these mentions and posts this data on Adafruit.</description>
