      <description>Radon Radon is everywhere, see map Naturally-occurring radioactive gas - causes lung cancer Inert, colorless and odorless Naturally in the atmosphere in trace amounts Outdoors: radon disperses rapidly Most radon exposure occurs inside homes, schools and workplaces Indoors: Radon gas becomes trapped indoors after it enters buildings through cracks and other holes in the foundation Can be controlled and managed with proven, cost-effective techniques Radon monitoring Hardware Airthings Wave Continuous radon monitoring Long term monitoring LEDs color â€“ radon level Battery Operated Bluetooth BLE ESP32 - lolin D32 (can use any ESP32) MQTT Server - Mosquitto Software Python script to read values from Airthings Wave: Wave-Reader Home Assistant Custom Component: sensor.</description>
