      <description>    Did you ever want to use ESP8266 to communicate to Home Assistant directly? Here we use a TCS34725 color sensor to read colors and change a RGB light in Home Assistant to the color observed.

      <title>Internet Connected Smoke Alarm</title>

      <description>Have you wondered how to build a internet connected smoke alarm using ESP8266 and a cheap Kidde RF-SM-DC?
Overall idea is to detect smoke alarm signals and send MQTT message. Home Assistant reads the MQTT message and sends out notifications that can be used to notify your local fire station.
ESP8266 sends a MQTT message until the smoke alarm is beeping.
Software Refer to https://github.com/debsahu/ESP_External_Interrupt to build the ESP8266 part of the internet connected smoke alarm.</description>

      <description>Wouldn’t it be nice to know if your dog’s water bowl is empty? Let us build a sensor that measures the water level every 5 minutes. This value is sent to MQTT server and Home Assistant automation takes care of the rest.
This sensor connects to MQTT and Home Assistant. See dogsensor.yaml for adding this to HA. Assumes that one has set up various notification sensors available in HA.</description>
