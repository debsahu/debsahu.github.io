      <description>Idea To convert an automatic trash can into a smart one.
Hardware  Automatic Trash Can Wemos D1 mini (ESP8266) 2N2222 transistor  Implementation Here we use an ESP8266 to tap into the pins and emulate a physical button press. The ESP8266 uses a code as described in https://github.com/debsahu/SmartTrashCan to emulate a Wemo Switch, which is detected by Alexa/Echo device as a switch.

      <description>    Getting one&amp;rsquo;s hands on APDS9960 is very easy, that can be used to detect hand gestures. Here we use this sensor to control lights on Home Assistant based on a gesture observed on sensor.

      <description>    Did you ever want to use ESP8266 to communicate to Home Assistant directly? Here we use a TCS34725 color sensor to read colors and change a RGB light in Home Assistant to the color observed.

      <title>Internet Connected Smoke Alarm</title>
      <link>https://www.debashishsahu.com/posts/internet-connected-smoke-alarm/</link>

      <description>Have you wondered how to build a internet connected smoke alarm using ESP8266 and a cheap Kidde RF-SM-DC?
Overall idea is to detect smoke alarm signals and send MQTT message. Home Assistant reads the MQTT message and sends out notifications that can be used to notify your local fire station.
ESP8266 sends a MQTT message until the smoke alarm is beeping.
Software Refer to https://github.com/debsahu/ESP_External_Interrupt to build the ESP8266 part of the internet connected smoke alarm.</description>

      <title>Internet Connected Dog Water Bowl Sensor</title>

      <description>Wouldn’t it be nice to know if your dog’s water bowl is empty? Let us build a sensor that measures the water level every 5 minutes. This value is sent to MQTT server and Home Assistant automation takes care of the rest.
This sensor connects to MQTT and Home Assistant. See dogsensor.yaml for adding this to HA. Assumes that one has set up various notification sensors available in HA.</description>
